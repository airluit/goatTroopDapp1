                    As mentioned, donations will be made periodically throughout the minting
                    process of the Goat Troops Infantry. Each milestone (25% minted) Goat Troops Infantry
                    will donate directly to all families affected by the terrorist attack that killed 13 US troops 
                    at the Kabul Airport in August 2021. A percentage of secondary sales will be donated to veterans 
                    and troops forever.
