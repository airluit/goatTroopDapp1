                <p>General Harold Ransom looked over the new recruits with a mixture of disappointment and excitement.
                            The recruits were raw, disorderly, and undeveloped. Some looked scared, others cocky. 
                             All had potential though but General Ransom did not take the responsibility 
                             of sending them to battle lightly.
                </p>

                <p>The goal wasn’t to make them killing machines, yet, that would come later in battle. 
                               The goal was to make them a team. The key wasn’t to beat them into following orders 
                               but rather to give them a common goal. For years Ransom had been doing this with new recruits. 
                               He was losing the energy to continue the good fight. It was becoming time
                               to pass the baton to a new generation, ones that would carry the same spirit forward.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Harold in his old age has seen it all over his career. He wasn’t perfect but there had been 
                             a few mistakes. He had addressed each and every mistake and been taking care of loose ends 
                             so he would be able to retire with a clear conscience. There were two things left on that 
                             list that would have to wait until after he spoke to the new recruits: oversee the destruction 
                             of the toxic waste warehouse (which none knew about) and do an accounting of the armory to
                             ensure no weapons were missing.

                    The drill sergeants were finishing up their introductions, hammering the troops like steel to 
                             remove all imperfections so they were ready for the battles to come. They had been screaming 
                             at the troops for hours to stand up straight, show respect; instilling the principles of
                              discipline, teamwork, and spirit. The troops were probably covered in a layer of spittle 
                              by now.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It was time to build the recruits up. Harold walked down the aisle lined with the chairs recruits
                              were sitting in, his knees aching with every step. His strength may not be what it used to be;
                               his endurance and eyesight were waning, but the fiery passion inside could still inspire the 
                               young and impressionable. They may not respect him yet but that would change soon. The words 
                               weren’t planned but they would come to him. 
                               This would be his last speech before calling it quits.

                    “Welcome Goat Troops Infantry. I know some of you may not be sure why you are here. Some of
                              you may have accidentally stumbled into this group thinking it sounded interesting. Others
                               of you may have been waiting for this opportunity your whole lives.
                              No matter the reasoning, you are here, and now you’re a family."

                    “Set aside who you were before. You’re a part of something bigger now.
                              I’ve given my life to this organization but my time is ending.”

                <p>The troops were still. They waited for more. He had the recruit's full attention.

                    “We will get through this together. We will make a difference. The world will feel our impact. 
                     We will leave it better than we found it and we will inspire others to do the same.”

                    "We have lost others in the past. We carry their dreams, their ambitions,
                     their spirit with us in everything we do. If one of you is lost, we will do the same. 
                     To lose one of us is to lose a piece of yourself."

                <p>

                <p>
                    "Now we are family. Outside of this space, you may have friends, family, and loved ones.
                    They too belong to our family. A family takes care of each other. When one feels pain or loss,
                    we all grieve together."
